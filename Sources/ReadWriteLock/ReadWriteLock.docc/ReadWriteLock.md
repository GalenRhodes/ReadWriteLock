# ``ReadWriteLock``

A Swift implementation of a [Read/Write lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writer_lock).

## Overview

I'm really amazed that the Swift Standard Library (nor the Objective-C standard library) has an implementation of a Read/Write lock. Especially since there is an implementation of all the other concurrency tools such as Mutex, Reentrant Lock, Conditional Lock, Semaphore, etc.

So I implemented it myself here. Enjoy.
